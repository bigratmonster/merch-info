<p>Hey, waddup. I’m Rico from bigrat.monster.</p>
<p>As 2020 comes to a close, I would like to thank you for purchasing merchandise for my little project.</p>
<p>As you may have heard, the bigrat.monster merch store is closing permanently and as you are reading this, it had already closed its doors.</p>
<p>bigrat.monster originally started as just a meme. I saw a screenshot of a 4chan post and thought it would be funny to make a website.</p>
<p>I am aware of the copyright issue at the very start since the picture isn't mine. The merch wasn't anyone's fault and technically isn't infringing anyones copyright, I'm just not comfortable with it. That ultimately lead to the decision to close the store.</p>
<p>Don't worry, while the merch store is gone, the main website is going to stay.</p>
<p>From the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank you once again for purchasing at the merch store and visiting the site. Everyone’s life changed a lot in 2020 but you brought a positive one to mine.</p>
<p>Stay positive and have a happy new year.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Rico<br>
1st January 2021
