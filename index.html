<p>Hey, waddup. I’m Rico from bigrat.monster.</p>
<p>As 2020 comes to a close, I would like to thank you for purchasing merchandise for my little project.</p>
<p>As you may have heard, the bigrat.monster merch store is closing permanently. As you are reading this, it had already closed its doors.</p>
<p>bigrat.monster originally started as just a meme. I saw a screenshot of a 4chan post and thought it would be funny to make a website.</p>
<p>I am aware of the copyright issue at the very start since the picture isn't mine, but when Skrub reached out to me about merch with a design from Fistbowl, I greenlit it. But in my heart, I wasn't sure if we're infringing copyright of the original picture. That ultimately lead to the decision to close the store, since I wasn't comfortable with it.</p>
<p>Don't worry, while the merch store is gone, the main website is going to stay.</p>
<p>From the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank you once again for purchasing at the merch store and visiting the site. Everyone’s life changed a lot in 2020 but you brought a positive one to mine.</p>
<p>Stay positive and have a happy new year.</p>

<p>Sincerely,
Rico
1st January 2021
